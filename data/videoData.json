There were plenty of highlights throughout the game, with several moments of individual brilliance and team play that had the crowd on the edge of their seats. Both sides had their fair share of chances, but it was ultimately Kolkata Knight Riders who came out on top with a victory. The game was a true showcase of Cricket at its finest and will be remembered for years to come."
